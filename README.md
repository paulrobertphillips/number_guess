# Number Guess Game Powered By Docker

**Description**<br>
I have built a very simple number guessing game in Python. The algorithm itself
generates a random number 1 through 10, and has the player guess what number that is.
The player has infinite number of tries to get it right, but can also quit after the
first attempt. If the player quits the program displays the correct answer. 

**Environment**<br>
The Python script is powered by Docker; that is, its entirety lives in the Docker-based virtual
environment. Docker handles the storage of cumulative score and number of attempts from
the previous game. A volume has been mounted in the Docker image so that the game can persist.

**Development**<br>
I have included a series of shell scripts to help standardize the development workflow in this
project. Each is labeled based on their actionable purpose. 
- *debug.sh*: runs the program without creating a daemon; prompts logging from running program
- *run.sh*: very similar to debug.sh but isn't passed any volumes; just runs an instance of the program
- *persist.sh*: runs program as intended; keeps record of the cumulative score and player attempts
- *stop.sh*: stops the number_guess program
- *shell.sh*: stops the currently running program and reboots program with shell access inside container (debugging)
- *clean_persist_volumn.sh*: purges the volume within the program; resets score records

**Next Steps**<br>
I intend to introduce a new layer to the persistent program; score & attempts by player. When the program
turns on it should display the player with the highest score and least attempts. The player will login
with their tagname and begin playing. I will attempt to keep the scores in Redis by player. Python will
either output a text file as it has been, which is read by Redis, or have Python write directly to Redis.
