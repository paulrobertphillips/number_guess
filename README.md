**Description**<br>
I have built a very simple number guessing game in Python. The algorithm itself simply
generates a random number 1 through 10, and has the player guess what number that is.
This Docker image is persistent; it keeps score of previous number of attempts before
guessing right (keeps last recorded score if a player gives up), and keeps score of 
the number of times the players collectively have guessed right
